# FlutterDrone
Code for building a drone with Flutter

I have modified the code from this page:
https://ghowen.me/build-your-own-quadcopter-autopilot/

Exact code I started with is here:
https://ghowen.me/build-your-own-quadcopter-autopilot/codeview.html

My code also uses an API function not yet publicly implemented, Flutter::getsystemBusActive(). That function is just a quick stab at scheduling times to run code that will not interfere with Flutter's radio operations. A much more complete and robust solution needs to be devised. My hope is that by making the basic sketch code available, someone will be able to provide input even without actually running this on a live system. If you want to run this code, please e-mail me.
